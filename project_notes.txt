# CrimCraft - Project Notes

## Development Environment
- Using WSL2 on Windows
- Need to install libasound2-dev for ALSA dependencies
- Build error with alsa-sys v0.3.1 related to missing system library

## Game Overview
CrimCraft is a basic Minecraft-like game built with Rust and the Bevy game engine. The player can mine and place blocks in a 3D world while avoiding a monster named Crim.

## Core Features
- 3D voxel-based world with randomly generated terrain
- Player starts with a pickaxe by default
- Mine blocks with left-click
- Place blocks with right-click
- Simple AI monster (Crim) that chases the player
- Build structures to hide from Crim

## Technical Implementation
- Using Bevy (v0.14.2) for game engine
- 3D rendering with basic PBR materials
- WASD + Space/Shift for movement
- Simple block interaction system
- Procedurally generated terrain
- Basic enemy AI with line-of-sight detection

## Project Structure
- `main.rs` - Main game code
- Components:
  - Player - The player character with pickaxe
  - Crim - The monster that chases the player
  - Block - Represents a block in the world
  - Position - Stores the grid position of entities
- Systems:
  - `setup` - Initializes the game world
  - `generate_world` - Creates the terrain and trees
  - `player_movement` - Handles WASD + Space/Shift movement
  - `crim_ai` - Makes Crim chase the player when in line of sight
  - `block_interaction` - Handles mining and placing blocks

## Future Improvements
- Add different block types with unique properties
- Improve Crim's AI (pathfinding, more intelligent behavior)
- Add player inventory system
- Add crafting system
- Improve world generation (caves, mountains, etc.)
- Add survival elements (health, hunger, etc.)
- Add day/night cycle
- Add sound effects and music
- Add simple UI (crosshair, inventory display)
- Add multiplayer support
